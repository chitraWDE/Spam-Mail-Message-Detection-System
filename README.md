# Spam-Mail-Message-Detection-System
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to differentiate between spam (unwanted/junk) and ham (legitimate/important) emails using Logistic Regression. Spam emails often contain malicious links, advertisements, or phishing attempts, while ham emails are regular messages from known sources.
